# CarbonTrackerGPT

Carbon Tracker uses GPT API to give recommendations based on users weekly carbon data.  
Users input there weekly carbon input via transportation (car, plane) then it calculates the total avg carbon emission weekly.
Based on these calculations we then give a GPT call in which GPT tells the users potential things they can change to improve their emission outputs.
