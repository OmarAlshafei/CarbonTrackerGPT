# CarbonTrackerGPT

Carbon Tracker uses GPT API to give recommendations based on users weekly carbon data.  
Users input their weekly carbon emmisioms via transportation (car, plane) then it calculates the total average carbon emission weekly.
Based on these calculations we then give a GPT call in which GPT tells the users potential aspects in their life they can change to improve their emission outputs.
